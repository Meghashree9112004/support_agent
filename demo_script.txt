Project Name: AI Support Assistant / FAQ & Ticket Resolver Agent

Hello, I am Meghashree and this is my AI Support Assistant project developed for Rooman’s AI Internship Challenge.

This agent is designed to resolve customer FAQs instantly using a knowledge base, and when a query doesn't match, it automatically converts the message into a support ticket for the admin team.

Let me show the demo:

On the homepage, we see a clean and user-friendly pink-themed chat UI.
I will type the question: "How to track my order?"
The agent immediately responds with the correct answer from the knowledge base.

Another feature is smart suggestions — as I type some text, for example “what is”, the system automatically recommends relevant questions, making it easy for the user to select instead of typing the full query.

Now let’s type a question that is NOT available in the FAQ list:
"Can I change my registered mobile number?"
The bot is unable to answer, so it automatically raises a ticket and gives a message:
"Thank you! Your issue has been converted to a ticket. Our support team will contact you."

This ensures that no customer query is ignored.

Next, I will open the admin panel:
Here the admin can see the list of tickets with status open or closed.
When the admin solves a ticket, clicking “Close” will update the status.

This system combines FAQ automation + ticket management in one AI agent.

Tech Stack Used:
• Python
• Flask + Streamlit UI
• JSON Knowledge Base for FAQs
• SQLite Database for Ticket Storage
• Frontend: HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Future Improvements:
• Login system for admin
• Email notification on ticket creation
• Add RAG + Vector Database for better AI responses

Thank you for watching this demo.
